This directory contains the implementation for predicting Protein-Protein Interactions (PPI) by concatenating 4 different types of protein embeddings
Please ensure you have the environment set up as defined in the root env.yml file.

- main_concat.py: Run this script for training and evaluating the PPI model using concatenated embeddings.

- model.py: Defines the neural network architecture used for the interaction prediction.

- concat_embeddings_robustness/: Contains results or scripts related to the robustness testing of the concatenation method.

- console_outputs/: Logs and terminal outputs from previous training runs for reference.
