#  DPEB: Deep Protein Embedding Benchmark Environment

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are fundamental to biological processes, yet researchers face significant challenges
in computational PPI prediction due to the lack of integrated, multimodal protein representations. We present DPEB,
the first searchable database focused exclusively on human proteins that integrates four distinct protein embedding
types—capturing complementary biological modalities from sequence to structure. DPEB combines structurally-informed
features (AlphaFold2 [18]), transformer-based sequence embeddings (BioEmbeddings [8]), contextual amino acid patterns
(ESM-2: Evolutionary Scale Modeling [23]), and sequence-based n-gram statistics (ProtVec [3]) to provide comprehensive
protein characterizations. While protein structures predicted by AlphaFold2 are broadly available through repositories
such as the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, access to the internal neural network embeddings generated by
AlphaFold2—particularly in a format suitable for downstream computational modeling—remains extremely limited. To
address this gap, DPEB provides, to our knowledge, the first large-scale, human-specific collection of AlphaFold2-derived
embeddings in a publicly accessible format, specifically designed for incorporation into predictive modeling framework with
other types of embeddings. Our benchmark evaluations demonstrate that GraphSAGE models utilizing BioEmbedding
representations achieve the highest performance (87.37% AUROC, 79.16% accuracy) for PPI prediction tasks, while our
framework correctly categorizes proteins into enzyme/non-enzyme classes with 77.42% accuracy and achieves 86.04%
accuracy for protein family classification. By making these diverse embeddings accessible through a unified framework
that supports multiple graph neural network architectures, DPEB accelerates research in systems biology, drug discovery,
and personalized medicine through more powerful protein interaction modeling.

This repository provides the environment setup used in our experiments related to deep protein embeddings, graph neural networks, and AlphaFold-based representations.
